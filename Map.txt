The OpenStreetMap area wrangled can be found in the URL below:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/2.9864/101.5748

The map chosen for data wrangling is an area in the state of Selangor (Malaysia) with high 
economic activity - covering Shah Alam, Subang Jaya and the government's new administrative 
township Putrajaya.

This area being my hometown, and the inclusion of the government's new administrative township 
make an interesting database to query.
